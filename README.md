# Server Software Hardening – Junior Class Project
> ⚠️ This is a learning project. It is **not** production-grade security, but a demonstration of tools and concepts.
This repository contains a junior–level class project focused on **hardening the infrastructure and surrounding services** for a Node.js web application.

The scope of the project was not to change the app’s business logic, but to build and secure the environment around it using **Docker, Jenkins, security scanning tools, and host monitoring**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Deploy a simple Node.js web application on a hardened server, wrapped in a basic DevSecOps pipeline.

**Key objectives:**

- Containerize the application with **Docker**.
- Deploy to a Linux server (Linode) with secure defaults.
- Run security scans in CI using:
  - **Snyk** (dependency / SCA)
  - **SonarQube** (static analysis / code quality)
  - **Trivy** (container image scanning)
  - **OWASP ZAP** (dynamic application security testing)
- Monitor the host and application using **Wazuh**.

The project was completed by a **17-person team**, with work split across infrastructure, CI/CD, and security tooling.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Application:** Node.js + Express (with server-side templating) - Not generated by us, but provided by our professor. The focus was DevSecOps
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins (Jenkinsfile pipeline)
- **Security & Scanning:**
  - Snyk
  - SonarQube
  - Trivy
  - OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)
- **Server Monitoring:** Wazuh
- **Hosting:** Linode (Linux server)

## 🔐 Security & Hardening Focus

Some of the hardening / security practices explored in this project:

- Restricting exposed ports and minimizing attack surface.
- Using environment variables for configuration instead of hard-coding secrets.
- Scanning application dependencies (**Snyk**) for known vulnerabilities.
- Running static analysis and quality checks via **SonarQube**.
- Scanning Docker images for CVEs with **Trivy**.
- Running **OWASP ZAP** against the running app to catch common web vulnerabilities.
- Deploying **Wazuh** agents to monitor logs, detect suspicious activity, and validate hardening steps.

## 📂 Repository Structure

> _Structure may vary slightly; update this section if your folder names differ._

- `Dockerfile` – Container image definition for the Node.js app.
- `docker-compose.yml` – Local orchestration of app and supporting services.
- `Jenkinsfile` – CI/CD pipeline configuration for builds and security scans.
- `package.json` / `package-lock.json` – Node.js dependencies.
- `src/` or `app/` – Application source (routes, views, etc.).
- `docs/` – Any project documentation / notes (if present).
